# Database-on-Eclipse
For this project, made during my exchange semester, we had to implement a database in JAVA on Eclipse and using MySQL. In the file 16_TP2-v01.pdf there are the instructions of this work and in the file 16_TP2-schema-BDR-v01.pdf, there is the implemented database schema. We also used Hibernate and we designed a validator for zip codes.
